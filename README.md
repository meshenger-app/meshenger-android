# Meshenger

Direct voice- and video phone calls. No need for accounts or access to the Internet. Just scan each others QR-Code that will contain the contacts IP address. This works at home or company networks but also in many off-the-grid networks such as community mesh networks.

Features:

- voice and video calls
- encrypted communication
- no accounts, no registration, no servers
- add custom addresses to reach contacts


Limitations:

- no calls through firewalls / NAT borders
- IP address change requires manual contact update

## Documentation

Meshenger connects to IP addresses in a true P2P fashion. Contacts are encoded in a text blob that can be exchanged via QR-Code, picture or copy&paste. They contain a name, a public key and a list of IP addresses or domain names. Also IPv6 link local addresses are supported, which would not even need a DHCP server. The exchanged public key is used to authenticate/encrypt signaling data to establish a [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) session that can transmit voice and video.

Details can be found in the [Documentation](docs/documentation.md) or in the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).
