 Voice- and video calls without any server or Internet access. Simply scan each others QR-Code and call each other. This works in many local networks such as community mesh networks, company networks or at home.

Features:

- voice and video calls

## Documentation

Meshenger connects to IP addresses in a true P2P fashion. Contacts are shared via QR-Code. They contain a name, a public key and a list of MAC/IP/DNS addresses. By default, only a single MAC address is transferred and used to create an IPv6 link local address (among others) to establish a connection. This does not even need a DHCP server. The exchanged public key is used to authenticate/encrypt signaling data to establish a [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) session that can transmit voice and video.

Details can be found in the [Documentation](docs/Documentation.md) or in the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).
