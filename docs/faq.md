# Frequently Asked Questions

* **How much bandwidth does an Audio/Video call consume?**  
    Audio calls take 12KB/s, Video adds ~80KB/s.
* **Why can't you call a thethered phone as client?**  
    IPv6 link local addresses seem to be blocked by Android in this kind of setup. Normal IPv4 addresses will work, but they might change on a whim at which point a connection will fail.
* **Why create a new phone App - there are so many!**  
    Most Apps do not work in no Internet, very limited broadcast/multicast scenarios. This project intends to motivate other projects to support this. It is good that this kind of App exists.
