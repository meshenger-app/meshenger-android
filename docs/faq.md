# Frequently Asked Questions

* **How much bandwidth does an Audio/Video call consume?**  
    Audio calls take 12KB/s for both directions, Video adds ~40KB/s per direction.
* **Why can't you call a thethered phone as client?**  
    IPv6 link local addresses seem to be blocked by Android in this kind of setup. Normal IPv4 addresses will work, but they might change on a whim at which point a connection cannot be established any more.
* **Why create a new phone App - there are so many!**  
    Most Apps do not work without Internet or when very limited broadcast/multicast communication is allowed. This project intends to motivate other projects to support this. It is good that this kind of App exists.
* **Can I call contacts over the Internet?**  
    In allmost all cases you can not. While Meshenger simply connects to IP addresses, most contacts can only be reached by local IP addresses that are not accessible over the Internet due to Firewalls and [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation).
